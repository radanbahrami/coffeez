<div class="terms-content" style="max-width: 700px; margin: 0 auto;">
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>Terms of Service</b></h2>
<p><b>Effective Date:</b> [Fill in date]</p>

<h3>1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
<p>By accessing or using Coffeez (“the Platform”), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (“Terms”). If you do not agree, do not use the Platform.</p>
<p>By using Coffeez, you acknowledge and agree that you are using the Platform <b>“AS IS”</b> and <b>“AS AVAILABLE”</b> without any warranty or guarantee of any kind.</p>

<h3>2. Description of Service</h3>
<p>Coffeez is a non-custodial, cryptocurrency-based platform enabling supporters (“Supporters”) to send voluntary, metaphorical “coffees” (donations) to creators (“Creators”) using the TRX cryptocurrency. All “coffees” are symbolic; no physical coffee is involved.</p>
<p>Creators must log in to receive support. Supporters may send donations without creating an account.</p>
<p>We use hCaptcha to protect our platform from bots and abuse. By using Coffeez, you also agree to the hCaptcha <a href="https://www.hcaptcha.com/terms" target="_blank"><u>Terms of Service</u></a> and <a href="https://www.hcaptcha.com/privacy" target="_blank"><u>Privacy Policy</u></a>.</p>

<h3>3. Eligibility</h3>
<p>The Platform is available to users worldwide. Creators associated with adult content or illegal activities may not use Coffeez.</p>

<h3>4. Account Registration for Creators</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
  <li>Creators must provide a display name, username, and profile picture, all of which must comply with copyright, trademark, and content restrictions.</li>
  <li>Content restrictions include prohibitions on:</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type: circle; padding-left: 32px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
    <li>Adult/sexually explicit content</li>
    <li>Hateful language</li>
    <li>Any content that violates applicable laws or infringes third-party rights</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Coffeez reserves the right to change or require changes to any display name or username if it infringes third-party trademarks, is misleading or impersonates others, or for any other reason deemed necessary.</li>
  <li>Coffeez reserves the right to suspend or terminate accounts at its discretion for violations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Payments</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
  <li>All donations are processed in TRX directly from the Supporter to the Creator’s wallet.</li>
  <li>Coffeez does <b>not</b> hold or control funds at any point.</li>
  <li><b>Coffeez takes no cut from your donation.</b> The only deduction is the TRX network fee, which goes to the blockchain, not Coffeez or the creator.</li>
  <li><b>Supporters must send TRX only on the TRON network (TRC20).</b> Sending TRX from other networks (such as Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain) will result in lost funds and the donation will not be verified or recoverable.</li>
  <li>The Supporter must send the exact amount of TRX specified to the exact wallet address shown. Any crypto sent to a wrong address cannot be recovered.</li>
  <li>The Supporter must send exactly the type of crypto specified, on exactly the network specified, otherwise the crypto may be lost and the donation will not be verified.</li>
  <li>Payment verification is based on exact TRX amounts generated by the Platform. Incorrect amounts will not be verified.</li>
  <li>For payment verification purposes, Coffeez applies a unique random decimal to the TRX amount required for each donation. This decimal is used solely for transaction identification and may cause the amount requested to be slightly higher than the base TRX value corresponding to the number of coffees purchased. Regardless of this decimal, the donation will be considered equivalent to the number of coffees selected at checkout.</li>
  <li>The TRX amount shown is generated at the time the donation is initiated and represents the TRX price equivalent at that moment. Because Coffeez may add the unique random decimal described above for verification, the displayed TRX amount may include that decimal; due to cryptocurrency market volatility, the TRX value may change before a transaction is confirmed. Supporters must send the exact TRX amount displayed at checkout, including any such random decimal.</li>
  <li>Supporters acknowledge that all payments are <b>final and non-refundable</b>.</li>
  <li>Supporters must confirm the coffee quantity shown before entering the payment process.</li>
  <li>Supporters must confirm the TRX amount before sending the transaction.</li>
  <li>Supporters can buy up to 50 coffees in each request and in each session.</li>
  <li>By sending TRX, Supporters affirm they are willingly providing a donation without expectation of goods, services, or benefits in return.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size:0.95em; margin-top:8px;"><b>Currency note:</b> Any reference to "$" or "dollars" on this Platform denotes United States Dollars (USD).</p>

  <li>Coffeez stores only the <b>public key</b>; the private key is shown only once to the Creator.</li>
